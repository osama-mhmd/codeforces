# Problem Solving üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### When to stop progressing in your approach to solve a problem?

- The solution is actually simple, if you are progressing without a clear algorithm, you should stop.
- If you are fixing sick issues (will be explained later), you should stop.
- If you are using a tape to make your solution work, you should stop.

## Lessons

- Write your procedure/approach first.
